## 1. Import Build-in Dataset

What it does: Loads a pre-existing dataset that is included with the program or package.

Inputs: None

Outputs: Dataset object (DataFrame)

Components used: Built-in dataset library

Side effects:Dataset becomes available in memory for analysis.

## 2. Import External Dataset -> We will not cover this. User will use existing packages (e.g., pandas)

## 3. Display Dataset -> We will not cover this. User will use existing packages (e.g., pandas)

## 4. Dataset Curation -> We will not cover this. User will use existing packages (e.g., pandas)

## 5. Magnitude Distribution

What it does: Analyzes and summarizes the distribution of values within the dataset.

Inputs: dataset

Outputs: Statistical summary or frequency distribution

Components used: Summary statistics and visualization tools

Side effects: None

## 6. One Variable Descriptive Analysis

What it does: Displays summary statistics for a single variable.

Inputs: Dataset column
