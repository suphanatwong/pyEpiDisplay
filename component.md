1. Import Build-in Dataset

What it does:
Loads a pre-existing dataset that is included with the program or package.

Inputs:
None

Outputs:
Dataset object (DataFrame)

Components used:
Built-in dataset library

Side effects:
Dataset becomes available in memory for analysis.

2. Import External Dataset -> We will not cover this. User will use existing packages (e.g., pandas)

3. Display Dataset -> We will not cover this. User will use existing packages (e.g., pandas)

4. Dataset Curation -> We will not cover this. User will use existing packages (e.g., pandas)

5. Magnitude Distribution

What it does:
