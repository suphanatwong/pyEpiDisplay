# Translating R Packages into Python: A Pilot Project of epiDisplay

## Project Overview:
Epidemiological data analysis increasingly needs to handle novel data sources such as imaging, text, signal, and genomic data, along with machine learning approaches. Some of these capabilities are limited in R but are rapidly expanding in Python. As a result, many epidemiologists are transitioning to Python; however, Python currently has limited epidemiological data analysis packages. We will (but not limited to): 
1) Develop a Python package that translates the core functionalities of the R package EpiDisplay.
2) Learn how to translate an existing R package into Python, including understanding differences in syntax, data structures, and library ecosystems between R and Python.
